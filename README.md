Pyseidon: Advanced Water Network Analysis and Simulation Library

Pyseidon is a comprehensive and flexible Python-based library designed for the analysis, simulation, 
and visualization of water distribution networks. Inspired by the powerful water deity of Greek mythology, 
this library provides insightful tools to help researchers and engineers efficiently model and interpret 
water flow patterns, demand patterns, and distribution system behaviour. 

Key Features:
- Flow pattern clustering using advanced KMeans and PCA analysis
- Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) for identifying the optimal number of clusters
- Data manipulation capabilities including dataset splitting, merging, and saving
- Detailed summary statistics for comprehensive data analysis
- Powerful visualization tools for water demand and flow patterns
- Ability to run simulation models on a node from EPANET by integrating with WNTR
